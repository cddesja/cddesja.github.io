	abstract = {The present study examined the psychometric properties of a brief parent-report daily checklist of toddler behavior (Parent Daily Report—Toddler Version; PDR-T). Data were collected from three groups of 18–36 month-olds who were followed longitudinally for approximately one year: (a) internationally adopted children (N ¼ 156); (b) children placed in foster care due to child maltreatment (N ¼ 79); and (c) community comparison children raised by their biological families (N ¼ 80). An exploratory factor analysis of this measure resulted in three factors, measuring aggressive/noncompliant, positive, and distress behaviors. While there were estimation issues with the positive and distress factors, the aggressive/noncompliant factor exhibited invariance across time and groups, and partial invariance between genders. Significant correlations were observed between this factor and measures of externalizing behavior and inhibitory control (r ¼ 0.26–0.56), but not shyness, fearfulness, or negative affect. This provides support for both convergent and discriminant validity. Reliability of this factor was adequate to good across time and group. Results provide preliminary support for the utility, reliability, and consistency of one factor of the PDR-T as an easy parent-report tool to assess daily patterns and changes in child aggressive/ noncompliant behavior over time.},
