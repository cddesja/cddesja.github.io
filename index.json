We examined factors hypothesized to moderate the effects of the Healthy Weight eating disorder/obesity prevention program that promotes gradual healthy changes, and Project Health that adds cognitive dissonance activities. College students at risk for both outcomes because of weight concerns (N = 364, 72% female) were randomized to these interventions or an educational video condition, completing pretest, posttest, and 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up assessments. Healthy Weight and Project Health produced significantly larger reductions in eating disorder symptoms versus video controls for individuals with higher negative affect, emotional eating, dietary fat/sugar intake, and per- ceived pressure to be thin. Project Health also produced significantly less increases in BMI versus video controls for individuals with lower negative affect. Results suggest that these interventions produce larger eating disorder symptom reductions for individuals at elevated risk for eating pathology but hint that weight gain prevention effects may be attenuated by elevated negative affect. Results imply that larger eating disorder symptom re- ductions will result when implemented with individuals with both weight concerns and one of the additionally identified risk factors.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Moderators of two dual eating disorder and obesity prevention programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicole B.

We assessed cortisol reactivity and coded emotion regulation during the speech portion of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST‐M). Parents reported on their children's social, academic, and behavioral adjustment. Results sug‐ gest that emotion regulation abilities increased with age, but this increase was greater for NA than PI youth. With regard to cortisol, piecewise growth modeling revealed that at higher levels of emotion regulation PI youth had greater baseline values (after a period of time allowing for acclimation to the laboratory) and had steeper recovery slopes than NA youth. There was also a main effect of emotion regulation on the re‐ activity slope suggesting that for both groups, as emotion regulation increased, the cortisol reactivity slope decreased. Finally, greater emotion regulation predicted fewer internalizing behavior problems for PI youth but not for NA youth.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Emotion regulation and cortisol reactivity during a social evaluative stressor: A study of post‐institutionalized youth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carrie DePasquale","Anneke Olson","Christopher David Desjardins","Jacqueline Olson","Katherine C.
