We examined factors hypothesized to moderate the effects of the Healthy Weight eating disorder/obesity prevention program that promotes gradual healthy changes, and Project Health that adds cognitive dissonance activities. College students at risk for both outcomes because of weight concerns (N = 364, 72% female) were randomized to these interventions or an educational video condition, completing pretest, posttest, and 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up assessments. Healthy Weight and Project Health produced significantly larger reductions in eating disorder symptoms versus video controls for individuals with higher negative affect, emotional eating, dietary fat/sugar intake, and perceived pressure to be thin. Project Health also produced significantly less increases in BMI versus video controls for individuals with lower negative affect. Results suggest that these interventions produce larger eating disorder symptom reductions for individuals at elevated risk for eating pathology but hint that weight gain prevention effects may be attenuated by elevated negative affect. Results imply that larger eating disorder symptom reductions will result when implemented with individuals with both weight concerns and one of the additionally identified risk factors.","tags":["prevention","obesity","eating disorders","dissonance","moderators"],"title":"Moderators of two dual eating disorder and obesity prevention programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicole B.

We assessed cortisol reactivity and coded emotion regulation during the speech portion of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST‐M). Parents reported on their children's social, academic, and behavioral adjustment. Results sug‐ gest that emotion regulation abilities increased with age, but this increase was greater for NA than PI youth. With regard to cortisol, piecewise growth modeling revealed that at higher levels of emotion regulation PI youth had greater baseline values (after a period of time allowing for acclimation to the laboratory) and had steeper recovery slopes than NA youth. There was also a main effect of emotion regulation on the re‐ activity slope suggesting that for both groups, as emotion regulation increased, the cortisol reactivity slope decreased. Finally, greater emotion regulation predicted fewer internalizing behavior problems for PI youth but not for NA youth.","tags":["adjustment","childhood","cortisol","emotion regulation","post‐institutionalized"],"title":"Emotion regulation and cortisol reactivity during a social evaluative stressor: A study of post‐institutionalized youth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carrie DePasquale","Anneke Olson","Christopher David Desjardins","Jacqueline Olson","Katherine C.

Data were collected from three groups of 18-36 month-olds who were followed longitudinally for approximately one year - (a) internationally adopted children (N = 156); (b) children placed in foster care due to child maltreatment (N = 79); and (c) community comparison children raised by their biological families (N = 80). An exploratory factor analysis of this measure resulted in three factors, measuring aggressive/noncompliant, positive, and distress behaviors. While there were estimation issues with the positive and distress factors, the aggressive/noncompliant factor exhibited invariance across time and groups, and partial invariance between genders. Significant correlations were observed between this factor and measures of externalizing behavior and inhibitory control (r = 0.26 – 0.56), but not shyness, fearfulness, or negative affect. This provides support for both convergent and discriminant validity. Reliability of this factor was adequate to good across time and group. Results provide preliminary support for the utility, reliability, and consistency of one factor of the PDR-T as an easy parent-report tool to assess daily patterns and changes in child aggressive/ noncompliant behavior over time.","tags":["psychometric","child behavior","aggression/noncompliance","parent-report","international adoption","foster care"],"title":"Examining the psychometric properties of the parent daily report—toddler version (PDR-T)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Desjardins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556713800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556713800,"objectID":"e96c5084d327a0d77c4702dc80474cd3","permalink":"https://cddesja.github.io/talk/power_talk/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/power_talk/","section":"talk","summary":"A talk on statistical power, errors, and effect sizes.","tags":["Power","Type I \u0026 Type II errors","Effect Size","Simulation","R"],"title":"All Power Analyses Are Wrong, How To Be More Right","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Okan Bulut","Christopher Desjardins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554451200,"objectID":"3d5136429616cec4e2c07a02a2966c7c","permalink":"https://cddesja.github.io/talk/big_data/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/big_data/","section":"talk","summary":"A workshop on big data with an application to education.","tags":["big data","R","machine learning"],"title":"Exploring, Visualizing, and Modeling Big Data with R","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Paul Rohde","Christopher David Desjardins","Danielle Arigo","Heather Shaw","Eric Stice"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"0cfbb4565c66cf9c34e486291b9cc717","permalink":"https://cddesja.github.io/publication/rohde-2018/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rohde-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The present study tested hypothesized mechanisms underlying the effects of two selective prevention interventions targeting both obesity and eating disorders (Healthy Weight and the newly developed Project Health), relative to video control. Tests examined mediation for the significant weight gain prevention and eating disorder symptom prevention effects previously reported. College students (N = 364; 72% women) with weight concerns were randomized to condition and assessed for 2-years post-intervention. Project Health participants had significant improvements in 2 of the 7 proposed mediators relative to comparisons (i.e., cognitive dissonance, the unhealthy Western dietary pattern) but change in these variables did not mediate its effect on long-term BMI change. Two variables emerged as full mediators of the eating disorder prevention effects for both experimental interventions - body dissatisfaction and negative affect. Analyses failed to support the exploratory hypothesis that change in eating disorder symptoms mediated the effects of condition on BMI gain. This report is the among the first to examine mediation for programs aimed at preventing both weight gain and eating disorders, particularly in mixed-gender groups. Mediational analyses are essential in identifying the mechanism of intervention action, which can inform improvements to prevention programs.","tags":["eating disorder","obesity","prevention","mediation","cognitive dissonance"],"title":"Mediators of two selective prevention interventions targeting both obesity and eating disorders","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher David Desjardins","Okan Bulut"],"categories":null,"content":"The companion R package, hemp, is available at https://github.com/cddesja/hemp\n","date":1525219200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525219200,"objectID":"aae75fcfae40882d07a29a9072b6a0e8","permalink":"https://cddesja.github.io/publication/hemp-book/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hemp-book/","section":"publication","summary":"The Handbook of Educational Measurement and Psychometrics Using R covers a variety of topics, including classical test theory; generalizability theory; the factor analytic approach in measurement; unidimensional, multidimensional, and explanatory item response modeling; test equating; visualizing measurement models; measurement invariance; and differential item functioning.","tags":["r","psychometrics","measurement","ctt","irt","data visualization"],"title":"The Handbook of Educational Measurement and Psychometrics Using R","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.J.
